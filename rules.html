                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
                    <li><strong>Archetypal Cards:</strong> According to the given name of your PDS Slice, you are
                        allowed to play any cards belonging to that slice. The general guideline is to search for
                        the archetypes in the EDOPro search engine (unless stated otherwise), but the best way to
                        see which card you are allowed to use is by using ⁠resource.</li>
                    <li><strong>Emperor Supports:</strong> After choosing a monster in your archetype as your
                        Emperor, you will get to play
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>Generic Monster, Spell, or Trap that directly support the Attribute, Type, and/or
                                Card Type of your emperor in its text (You can see the list of usable cards in
                                ⁠resource).</li>
                            <li>Any Normal Monster that shares both the Attribute and Type of the Emperor.</li>
                            <li>The Kaiju Files: You can also choose to play up to a playset of the Kaiju that
                                shared the same attribute as your Emperor (in the case of LIGHT, Jizukiru is the
                                selected option).</li>
                        </ul>
                        Emperor Supports CANNOT be chosen as an Emperor.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Inclusions:</strong> Additional Inclusions are cards that are
                        specifically mentioned on the text of an archetypal card (including as its Summoning
                        Condition) but does not belong to that archetype.
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>e.g. Torrential Tribute is mentioned in the text of Fury of Kairyu-Shin</li>
                            <li>e.g. Majestic Dragon is mentioned in the summoning condition of Majestic Red Dragon
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        You are allowed to play Additional Inclusions in your Deck based on the allowed number on
                        the PDS F&L List. Additional Inclusions CANNOT be chosen as an Emperor.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Worthless Inclusions:</strong> Worthless Inclusions are unspecified cards that are
                        required to fulfill the summoning condition or activation cost of an archetypal card.
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>e.g. a Machine "Cyber" with different attribute is required to activate the effect

                            <li>e.g. a Deck with a Synchro Monster but no Tuner to use it</li>
                        </ul>
                        You are allowed to play Worthless Inclusions in your Deck based on the allowed number on the
                        PDS F&L List. Which card is considered to be the Worthless Inclusion will be decided by the
                        people. Worthless Inclusions CANNOT be chosen as an Emperor.

                            <li>e.g. Cyber Ogre (who is pretty useless) can be played in Cyberdark to activate

                            <li>e.g. a random Tuner(s) (preferably a vanilla with 0/0) with Level that is possible
                                to become Synchro Materials for said Synchro Monster can be played. (If you play 3
                                of that Synchro Monster, you can play up to 3 worthless tuners, either 3 different
                                ones or a playset)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Miscellaneousaurus:</strong> When a card requires specific conditions that the
                        archetype itself cannot fulfill, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                            <li>e.g. You are allowed to have a full extra deck of random monsters to banish
                                face-down in Nemleria</li>
                            <li>e.g. You are allowed to have cards in your Extra Deck (whose Level is higher than
                                all the Nekroz monster) to activate Nekroz Kaleidoscope in Nekroz (up to the number
                                of Nekroz Kaleidoscope you play)</li>
                            <li>e.g. You are allowed to have cards in Extra Deck to banish for the effect of Gizmek
                                Orochi the Serpentron Sky Slasher in Gizmek (a playset for each copy of Orochi you
                                play)</li>
                            <li>Decks with fusion monsters but no archetypal fusion spells are allowed to play 3
                                copies of Polymerization</li>
                        </ul>
                        Make sure to always check ⁠resource to see which card belongs to which slice.

                </ol>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Cards you are NOT allowed to play</h3>
                <p>Unless the card is strictly banned on the PDS Forbidden List (you can see this in ⁠resource), you
                    can play 03 copies of it. However, with good sportsmanship in mind, refrain from playing
                    floodgates or cards that would generally make the game unenjoyable.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Deck Size Rules</h3>
                <p>Minimum deck size is 20, Maximum deck size is 40 with at least 15 cards belonging to the slice.
                    The maximum count for Emperor support is 9 between your Main, Extra, and Side Deck. Both
                    Worthless and Additional Inclusions are considered as Archetypal cards.</p>
