                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">A. Deckbuilding Guide:</h3>
                <p><strong>Step 1: Choose a Slice:</strong> PDS is played using Slices as the basis. A player must choose a Slice of their choice and build a deck consisting of at least 15 Main Deck cards belonging to that slice. Each Slice belongs to one of the following Tier:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Tier 6: Divinity</strong> - Slices that are well-rounded in both power and consistency. Those with the strength to set up a formidable board with multiple interruptions with shocking consistency going 1st, but also the capacity to break boards and go for lethal with the help of both internal and external tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 5: Imperial</strong> - Slices that also have both power and consistency, but just shy of the Divinity title. The power of their end board might be a bit weaker compared to those above, or perhap they lack the ability to go 2nd into board-states filled with interruptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 4: Noble</strong> - Slices that are either decent in power but lacking in consistency, or vice versa. These slices might setup a board that is strong, but is definitely beatable by most of the decks from the tiers above. On the other hand, they could also have the necessary tools to build up a strong board presence going 1st, but are just completely unable to play from a blind 2nd position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 3: Squire</strong> - Slices that share the same attributes as the Noble tier, but are just missing a few more moving pieces to boaster them out of mediocrity. For an average player, their board strength, consistency, and going-2nd capacity might be just the middle of the road; but in the hand of the right player, these can still be a force to be reckoned with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 2: Feeble</strong> - Slices that lacks both the board presence going 1st and the resilience going 2nd. They still have a game plan, but that game plan might be incredibly inconsistent to setup, very easy to be stopped or to go wrong, or just simply not worth the effort to deploy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 1: Plague-Rat</strong> - Slices with no game plan, or one that is too irrelevant and difficult to achieve. These slices might sometimes not even perform like a playable strategy, but moreso just a set of mismatched cards tied together by a string of similarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tier 0: Restricted</strong> - Slices with an overall unfun playstyles, or those that would simply be way too powerful from a mechanical standpoint due to the rules of the format. you are not allowed to play these Slices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 2: Choose your Emperor:</strong> After having a deck of at least 15 Main Deck cards from a slice, the player must choose 01 monster their Main or Extra Deck as an Emperor. Afterward, note down the Emperor's...:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>Attribute: includes EARTH, FIRE, WATER, WIND, DARK, LIGHT, and DIVINE</li>
                    <li>Type: includes Aqua, Beast, Beast-Warrior, etc.</li>
                    <li>Class: includes Normal, Gemini, Ritual, Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, Link, and Generalist (if your Emperor is neither of the above). (The Generalist armory will consist of some unique cards that would either aid decks that are tribute summon, flip summon or combat-focused, or simply provide some fully-generic utility Link/Synchro/Xyz for decks that would not benefit from any other armories.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Step 3: Choose from your Emperor's Support Armory:</strong> After choosing an Emperor, the player can choose to play Support cards from the Armories correlating with their Attribute, Type, and Class.</p>
                <p>For example, if Cyber Dragon Infinity (LIGHT/Machine/Xyz) is your Emperor, you will get to play cards belonging to the LIGHT Armory, the Machine Armory, and the Xyz Armory</p>
                <p>A player can only play up to 9 Support cards in their Main, Extra, and Side Deck.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 4: Choose your Oblivia:</strong> Obliviae are powerful utility cards used to break board in an attempt to neutralize the game-state for the person going 2nd. These are separated into 02 types:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Supreme Oblivia</strong> - Allowed to be played for Tier 6 (Divinity), Tier 5 (Imperial), and Tier 4 (Noble).</li>
                    <li><strong>Lesser Oblivia</strong> - Allowed to be played for any Tier.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A player can only play 01 and only up to 01 playset (03 copies) Oblivia across their Main and Side Deck. Obliviae are also treated as Support cards and are counted toward the upper limit of 9 Support cards a player is allowed in their Main, Extra, and Side Deck.</p>
                <p>In total, a Deck must contain a minimum of 20 cards and a maximum of 40 cards in the Main Deck.</p>
                <p>Some miscellaneous rules regarding deck building includes:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>A card whose name is specifically mentioned (either as part of an effect or as a summoning material) by a card belonging to a slice in your Main or Extra Deck is treated as a card belonging in that slice. This means it can be played in a player's Main, Extra, and/or Side Deck and is treated as a card in that slice.</li>
                    <li>E.g. In the Slice Ojama/Armed Dragon, a player might play VWXYZ-Armed Dragon Catapult Cannon. If they chose to do so, they are allowed to play the 02 cards whose names were specifically mentioned on it, VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon and Armed Dragon LV7. Furthermore, since those 02 cards are now treated as a card belonging to the Slice, you are also allowed to play the cards that they specifically mentioned, VW-Tiger Catapult, XYZ-Dragon Cannon, and Armed Dragon LV5 respectively. All of those cards will be counted toward the minimum of 15 cards belonging to that Slice.</li>
                    <li>If a player's chosen Emperor is a Fusion Class, that player is allowed to play up to 03 copies of Polymerization in their Main and/or Side Deck. These are NOT treated as Support cards.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">B. The PDS' Forbidden & Limited List</h3>
                <p>PDS is played using an unique F&L List. The guidelines for the List are as follows:</p>
                <p>Cards that are among these categories are banned in PDS:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>Cards that are (or would enable other card(s) to be) permanently unaffected by other cards' effects;</li>
                    <li>Cards with strong interruption that are also (or would also enable other card(s) to be) temporarily unaffected by other cards' effects</li>
                    <li>Cards that has a mix of strong protection and interruptions;</li>
                    <li>Cards with oppressive lingering floodgate effects (Restriction to Summons, Effects and/or Activations);</li>
                    <li>Cards that allow FTKs or FTK-adjacent game plan even at 01 copy per Deck (non-HOPT handloop, deck-out, strong burn effect, infinite loops, etc.);</li>
                    <li>Support cards that are overpowered for the format's standard and are easy to make (or would enable other overpowered card(s) to be made) in most Decks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Cards that are among these categories are limited in PDS:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>Cards that would cause unhealthy game state, FTKs, or FTK-adjacent game plan at multiple (non-HOPT handloop, deck-out, strong burn effect, infinite loops, cards that are (or would enable other card(s) to be) immune to responses, etc.);</li>
                    <li>Support cards that are banned/limited in the TCG;</li>
                    <li>Support cards that are overpowered for the format's standard but may not be accessible for most Decks.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">C. Matches Guideline</h3>
                <p>(This portion of the rule is only applicable for this server and should only be used as a reference for external plays of the format)</p>
                <p>There are 02 types of matches that can be played:</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">League Matches:</h4>
                <p>A League is a pre-determined set of matches between Slices within the same Tier. Each League will contain multiple Brackets of 10. Within each Bracket, the 10 Slices will duel each other until all of them has played 03 matches. The result are handled as follows:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li>If a Slice gets 03 wins, it will move up a Tier;</li>
                    <li>If a Slice gets 01 - 02 wins, it will remain in the current Tier;</li>
                    <li>If a Slice gets 0 win, it will move down a Tier.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each Bracket should be finished in 02 weeks.</p>
                <h4 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Redemption Matches:</h4>
                <p>If a Slice received additional new support from the TCG/OCG, the player may choose to do one of the followings:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                    <li><strong>Rank-Up-Matches (RUM):</strong> Choose 03 Slices from the Tier above and play matches against each of them. If the newly supported Slice managed to win 02 out of those 03 matches, it will move up a Tier;</li>
